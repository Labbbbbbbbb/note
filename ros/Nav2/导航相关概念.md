## Action Server

As ROS, action servers are a common way to control long running tasks like **navigation**, which needs a long time to carry on and complete the task. In this situation, action servers and clients allow us to call a  long-running task in another process or thread and return a future to  its result. 

Action server 具有反馈机制。

Action servers are used in this stack to communicate with the highest level Behavior **Tree (BT) navigator** through a `NavigateToPose` action message. They are also used for the BT navigator to communicate with the  s**ubsequent smaller action servers** to compute plans, control efforts, and recoveries. Each will have their own unique `.action` type in `nav2_msgs` for interacting with the servers.



## Lifecycle Nodes and Bond

> ### Managed nodes
>
> #### Background:
>
> A managed life cycle for nodes allows **greater control** over the state  of ROS system. It will allow roslaunch to **ensure that all components have been  instantiated correctly** before it allows any component to begin executing its behaviour. It will also allow nodes to be restarted or replaced on-line.
>
> The most important concept of this document is that a managed node  presents a known interface, executes according to a known life cycle  state machine, and otherwise can be considered a black box. This allows freedom to the node developer on how they provide the  managed life cycle functionality, while also ensuring that any tools  created for managing nodes can work with any compliant node.

>
> There are 4 primary states:
>
> - `Unconfigured`
> - `Inactive`
> - `Active`
> - `Finalized`
>
> To transition out of a primary state requires action from an external  supervisory process, with the exception of an error being triggered in  the `Active` state.
>
> There are also 6 transition states which are intermediate states during a requested transition.
>
> - `Configuring`
> - `CleaningUp`
> - `ShuttingDown`
> - `Activating`
> - `Deactivating`
> - `ErrorProcessing`
>
> In the transitions states logic will be executed to determine if the transition is successful. Success or failure shall be communicated to lifecycle management software through the lifecycle management interface.
>
> There are 7 transitions exposed to a supervisory process, they are:
>
> - `create`
> - `configure`
> - `cleanup`
> - `activate`
> - `deactivate`
> - `shutdown`
> - `destroy`
>
> 
>
> ### Primary State: Unconfigured
>
> This is the life cycle state the node is in immediately after being instantiated. This is also the state in which a node may be returned to after an error has happened(**错误发生的时候会转换到这个状态**). In this state there is expected to be no stored state（**无储存状态**）.
>
> #### Valid transition out
>
> - The node may transition to the `Inactive` state via the `configure` transition.
> - The node may transition to the `Finalized` state via the `shutdown` transition.
>
> ### Primary State: Inactive
>
> This state represents a node that is **not currently performing any processing**.
>
> The main purpose of this state is to allow a node to be (re-)configured without altering its behavior while it is running.(**可以允许节点在运行过程中改变配置**)
>
> While in this state, the node will not receive any execution time to  read topics, perform processing of data, respond to functional service  requests, etc. （**不会执行并处理信息**）
>
> In the inactive state, any data that arrives on managed topics will not be read and or processed. Data retention will be subject to the configured QoS policy for the topic. （**遵循Qos policy**）
>
> Any managed service requests to a node in the inactive state will not be answered (to the caller, they will fail immediately).  （**节点不回答**）
>
> #### Valid transitions out of Inactive
>
> - A node may transition to the `Finalized` state via the `shutdown` transition.
> - A node may transition to the `Unconfigured` state via the `cleanup` transition.
> - A node may transition to the `Active` state via the `activate` transition.
>
> ### Primary State: Active
>
> This is the main state of the node’s life cycle. While in this state, the node performs any processing, responds to  service requests, reads and processes data, produces output, etc.  (**正常运行阶段**)
>
> If an ==error== that cannot be handled by the node/system occurs in this state, the node will transition to `ErrorProcessing`.  （**错误发生，将会转换到这个状态**）
>
> #### Valid transitions out of Active
>
> - A node may transition to the `Inactive` state via the `deactivate` transition.
> - A node may transition to the `Finalized` state via the `shutdown` transition.
>
> ### Primary State: Finalized
>
> The `Finalized` state is the state in which the node ends immediately before being destroyed. This state is always terminal the only transition from here is to be destroyed. （**将会寄的时候**）
>
> This state exists to support debugging and introspection. A node which has failed will remain visible to system introspection and  may be potentially introspectable by debugging tools instead of directly destructing. If a node is being launched in a respawn loop or has known reasons for  cycling it is expected that the supervisory process will have a policy  to automatically destroy and recreate the node.
>
> #### Valid transitions out of Finalized
>
> - A node may be deallocated via the `destroy` transition.
>
> ### Transition State: Configuring
>
> In this transition state the node’s `onConfigure` callback will be called to allow the node to load its configuration and conduct any required setup.
>
> The configuration of a node will typically involve those tasks that  must be performed once during the node’s life time, such as obtaining  permanent memory buffers and setting up topic publications/subscriptions that do not change.
>
> The node uses this to set up any resources it must hold throughout  its life (irrespective of if it is active or inactive). As examples, such resources may include topic publications and  subscriptions, memory that is held continuously, and initialising  configuration parameters.
>
> #### Valid transitions out of Configuring
>
> - If the `onConfigure` callback succeeds the node will transition to `Inactive`
> - If the `onConfigure` callback results in a failure code (TODO specific code) the node will transition back to `Unconfigured`.
> - If the `onConfigure` callback raises or results in any other result code the node will transition to `ErrorProcessing`
>
> ### Transition State: CleaningUp
>
> In this transition state the node’s callback `onCleanup` will be called. This method is expected to clear all state and return the node to a functionally equivalent state as when first created. If the cleanup cannot be successfully achieved it will transition to `ErrorProcessing`.
>
> #### Valid transitions out if CleaningUp
>
> - If the `onCleanup` callback succeeds the node will transition to `Unconfigured`.
> - If the `onCleanup` callback raises or results in any other return code the node will transition to `ErrorProcessing`.
>
> ### Transition State: Activating
>
> In this transition state the callback `onActivate` will be executed. This method is expected to do any final preparations to start executing. This may include acquiring resources that are only held while the node  is actually active, such as access to hardware. Ideally, no preparation that requires significant time (such as lengthy  hardware initialisation) should be performed in this callback.
>
> #### Valid transitions out if Activating
>
> - If the `onActivate` callback succeeds the node will transition to `Active`.
> - If the `onActivate` callback raises or results in any other return code the node will transition to `ErrorProcessing`.
>
> ### Transition State: Deactivating
>
> In this transition state the callback `onDeactivate` will be executed. This method is expected to do any cleanup to start executing, and should reverse the `onActivate` changes.
>
> #### Valid transitions out of Deactivating
>
> - If the `onDeactivate` callback succeeds the node will transition to `Inactive`.
> - If the `onDeactivate` callback raises or results in any other return code the node will transition to `ErrorProcessing`.
>
> ### Transition State: ShuttingDown
>
> In this transition state the callback `onShutdown` will be executed. This method is expected to do any cleanup necessary before destruction. It may be entered from any Primary State except `Finalized`, the originating state will be passed to the method.
>
> #### Valid transitions out of ShuttingDown
>
> - If the `onShutdown` callback succeeds the node will transition to `Finalized`.
> - If the `onShutdown` callback raises or results in any other return code the node will transition to `ErrorProcessing`.
>
> ### Transition State: ErrorProcessing
>
> This transition state is where any error can be cleaned up. It is possible to enter this state from any state where user code will be executed. If error handling is successfully completed the node can return to `Unconfigured`, If a full cleanup is not possible it must fail and the node will transition to `Finalized` in preparation for destruction.
>
> Transitions to `ErrorProcessing` may be caused by error return codes in callbacks as well as methods within a callback or an uncaught exception.
>
> #### Valid transitions out of ErrorProcessing
>
> - If the `onError` callback succeeds the node will transition to `Unconfigured`. It is expected that the `onError` will clean up all state from any previous state. As such if entered from `Active` it must provide the cleanup of both `onDeactivate` and `onCleanup` to return success.
> - If the `onShutdown` callback raises or results in any other result code the node will transition to `Finalized`.
>
> ### Destroy Transition
>
> This transition will simply cause the deallocation of the node. In an object oriented environment it may just involve invoking the destructor. Otherwise it will invoke a standard deallocation method. This transition should always succeed.
>
> ### Create Transition
>
> This transition will instantiate the node, but will not run any code beyond the constructor.
>
> ## Management Interface
>
> A managed node will be exposed to the ROS ecosystem by the following interface, as seen by tools that perform the managing. This interface should not be subject to the restrictions on communications imposed by the lifecycle states.
>
> It is expected that a common pattern will be to have a container  class which loads a managed node implementation from a library and  through a plugin architecture automatically exposes the required  management interface via methods and the container is not subject to the lifecycle management. However, it is fully valid to consider any implementation which provides this interface and follows the lifecycle policies a managed node. Conversely, any object that provides these services but does not behave  in the way defined in the life cycle state machine is malformed.
>
> These services may also be provided via attributes and method calls  (for local management) in addition to being exposed ROS messages and  topics/services (for remote management). In the case of providing a ROS middleware interface, specific topics  must be used, and they should be placed in a suitable namespace.
>
> Each possible supervisory transition will be provided as a service by the name of the transition except `create`. `create` will require an extra argument for finding the node to instantiate. The service will report whether the transition was successfully completed.
>
> ### Lifecycle events
>
> A topic should be provided to broadcast the new life cycle state when it changes. This topic must be latched. The topic must be named `lifecycle_state` it will carry both the end state and the transition, with result code. It will publish every time that a transition is triggered, whether successful or not.
>
> ## Node Management
>
> There are several different ways in which a managed node may  transition between states. Most state transitions are expected to be coordinated by an external  management tool which will provide the node with it’s configuration and  start it. The external management tool is also expected monitor it and execute  recovery behaviors in case of failures. A local management tool is also a possibility, leveraging method level  interfaces. And a node could be configured to self manage, however this is  discouraged as this will interfere with external logic trying to managed the node via the interface.
>
> There is one transition expected to originate locally, which is the `ERROR` transition.
>
> A managed node may also want to expose arguments to automatically configure and activate when run in an unmanaged system.
>
> ## Extensions
>
> This lifecycle will be required to be supported throughout the  toolchain as such this design is not intended to be extended with  additional states. It is expected that there will be more complicated application specific  state machines. They may exist inside of any lifecycle state or at the macro level these lifecycle states are expected to be useful primitives as part of a  supervisory system.

生命周期 (或被管理的，更正确的) 节点是ROS 2独有的。更多信息可以是 [在这里](https://design.ros2.org/articles/node_lifecycle.html) 。它们是包含状态机转换的用于加载和卸载ROS 2服务器的节点。这有助于确定ROS系统启动和关闭的状态是否正常。它还帮助用户根据实际用途（商业或调试）以合理的方式构建他们的程序。

当一个节点启动时，它处于未配置状态，只处理节点的构造函数，该构造函数不应包含任何 ROS 网络设置或参数读取。通过启动系统或提供的生命周期管理器，需要通过配置将节点转换为非活动状态。之后，可以通过激活阶段的转换来激活节点。

这种状态将允许节点处理信息，并完全设置为运行状态。在配置阶段，触发 `on_configure()` 方法，将设置所有参数、ROS网络接口，以及安全系统，所有动态内存的分配。在激活阶段、触发 `on_activate()` 方法的将激活ROS网络接口，并设置程序中的任何状态以开始处理信息。 

要关闭（该节点）即过渡到停用需要清理、关闭，并以最终状态结束。网络接口分别在这些阶段被停用并停止处理、释放内存、干净地退出。

生命周期节点框架在整个项目中被广泛使用，所有服务器都使用它。如果可能的话，所有ROS系统最好使用生命周期节点。

在Nav2中，我们使用 `nav2_util LifecycleNode` 的包装器。这种包装包装了典型应用的生命周期节点的许多复杂性。它还包括生命周期管理器的连接 `bond` ，以确保服务器转换后，它也保持活动状态。如果服务器崩溃，它会让生命周期管理器知道并向下过渡系统，以防止严重故障。详见 



## 行为树

行为树 (BT)  在复杂的机器人任务中变得越来越普遍。它们是待完成任务的树形结构。行为树为定义多步或多状态应用程序创建了一个更具可扩展性和人类可理解性的框架。这与有限状态机 (FSM)  相反，后者可能有几十个状态和数百个状态过渡。一个例子就是踢足球机器人。将足球比赛的逻辑嵌入FSM将具有挑战性，且容易出错因为有许多可能的状态和规则。此外，像从左侧、右侧或中间射门这样的建模选择尤其不清楚。使用行为树则可以为许多行为创建和重用基本原语，像  "kick"   "walk"   "go to ball" 。更多信息可以在 [这本书](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00084) 找到。强烈建议阅读第1-3章，以更好地理解术语和工作流程。大约需要30分钟。

Nav2项目使用 [BehaviorTree CPP V3](https://www.behaviortree.dev/) 作为行为树库。在 `BT Navigator` 中，创建了可以构建为行为树的节点插件。将节点插件加载到BT中，并且在解析该行为树的XML文件时，将关联注册的名称。此时，我们可以通过该行为树进行导航。  

使用此库的一个原因是它能够加载子树。这意味着可以将Nav2行为树加载到另一个更高级别的BT中，以将此项目用作节点插件。一个例子是在足球比赛中，使用Nav2行为树作为  "go to ball" 节点，将足球检测作为更大任务的一部分。此外，为BT提供了一个 `NavigateToPoseAction` 插件，因此可以从客户端应用程序通过通常的动作接口调用Nav2软件堆栈
